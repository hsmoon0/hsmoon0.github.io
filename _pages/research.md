My work spans systems neuroscience, multimodal neuroimaging, and machine
learning to reveal mechanisms underlying Alzheimer’s disease risk,
neurodegeneration, and brain aging. I work across mouse behavior, transcriptomics, 
connectomics, imaging biomarkers, and deep learning pipelines. 




## 1. Olfactory Neuroscience of Alzheimer’s Disease Risk in APOE Mouse Models

I studied how Alzheimer’s disease risk first emerges in the sensory systems, particularly
the olfactory circuit, one of the earliest and most vulnerable networks affected in AD.
My work combines behavioral neuroscience, high-resolution diffusion MRI, tractography,
and blood–brain transcriptomics to dissect how APOE genotype, age, immune background,
and diet shape odor-guided behavior and its underlying neural circuits. I conducted a comprehensive battery of olfactory assays, including odor salience across
multiple concentrations, habituation–dishabituation to assess novelty detection, and
short, long, and extended-term odor memory. These paradigms capture perceptual
sensitivity, learning, exploratory drive, and memory consolidation. Across APOE cohorts,
aging and high-fat diet intensify olfactory deficits in APOE4 carriers, whereas APOE2
mice show greater behavioral resilience. Memory tasks reveal that APOE4 mice exhibit
the least improvement from short to long-term odor memory and the steepest decline
from 24 h to 48 h, indicating weaker consolidation and retention. In contrast, APOE2 mice
maintain stronger extended-term memory across age and diet conditions. These patterns highlight genotype-specific sensory–cognitive
vulnerability within olfactory-hippocampal networks.

To understand the neural basis of these behavioral changes, I pair behavioral testing with
ex vivo high-resolution diffusion MRI (45 μm isotropic), microstructural mapping, and
connectome reconstruction. This approach reveals genotype and age-dependent
alterations in olfactory–limbic hubs, including the piriform cortex, amygdalo-piriform
transition area, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and subicular complex—regions that
support odor memory and are among the earliest affected by AD pathology. Blood and
brain RNA-seq further identify eigengene modules whose expression patterns mirror
diffusion and connectivity changes in these regions, with enrichment for synaptic signaling,
ion homeostasis, neurotransmitter regulation, and glutamatergic processes.

The key finding from this line of work is that olfactory behavior provides an early and
highly sensitive window into Alzheimer’s disease vulnerability. Reduced novelty
detection, slower habituation, and weaker long-term and extended-term odor memory in
APOE4 mice closely align with microstructural disruption in piriform, entorhinal,
hippocampal, and subicular regions—circuits essential for odor learning and recognition.
Elastic Net multiset CCA reveals diffusion-derived subnetworks within these regions that
account for a substantial portion of variance in odor-guided behaviors (up to 24%). 
Blood-derived eigengene modules also track microstructural changes in these same 
olfactory–limbic pathways, linking peripheral molecular signatures to central 
sensory–cognitive decline. Together, this work establishes olfactory behavior, 
olfactory–memory circuits, and their associated transcriptomic patterns as 
a translatable biomarker axis for early Alzheimer’s disease risk.

The first panel shows clustering of diffusion and volumetric microstructure across key
olfactory and memory-associated regions. The second panel shows high-weight multimodal
connections identified by Elastic Net multiset CCA that explain a substantial portion of
variance in odor-guided behaviors.
