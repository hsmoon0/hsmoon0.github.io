Hi, thanks for stopping by! 👋

I am a researcher working at the intersection of multimodal neuroimaging,
connectomics, and machine learning. My work focuses on understanding
Alzheimer’s disease risk by integrating diffusion MRI, structural imaging,
behavioral assays, transcriptomics, and blood–brain molecular signatures.

My Ph.D. research in Biomedical Engineering at Duke University centered on building
computational pipelines and deep learning models to link brain structure and
network connectivity with age and genotype-related vulnerabilities.
I combine imaging, behavior, and omics-based biomarkers to uncover mechanisms
that contribute to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

I completed my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, a B.S.A.S. in Electrical
Engineering, and an M.S. in Biomedical Engineering at Washington University
in St. Louis, where I developed my foundation in quantitative imaging,
signal processing, and computational neuroscience.
